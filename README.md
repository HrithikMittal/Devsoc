<h1>
	IDEA OF THE PROJECT
</h1>
<p>
	Our application basically consists of three main modules which are as follows - 
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Medicine Check</b> - This module will help us to detect whether the medicines that we are getting, are original or not, i.e, whether they are not cloned or duplicated. 
		</li/>
		<li>
			<b>Emergency Push Button</b> - This module helps to send emergency message to nearby ambulances, so that if a person, home alone come accross a medical emergency, then, he can just press a single button, and nearby ambulance can handle the situation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Medical ChatBot</b> - This module helps the common people and all the doctors to come at a place and can chat either privately or publically. As , we are using cryptography in this module, so that mentally weak people will not fall prey to hackers and people who use weak people to loot them.
		</li>
	</ol>
